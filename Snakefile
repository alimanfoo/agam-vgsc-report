# The rules in this section all require data from an external source
# (e.g., the Ag1000G FTP site, or VectorBase). N.B., these rules
# assume you have a local copy of the Ag1000G FTP site (at least the
# files needed). Because these rules need external data, they cannot
# be run during continuous integration checks.


# This rule is an example of how to include a Jupyter notebook in the
# data build. The notebook depends on some data from the Ag1000G FTP
# site.
