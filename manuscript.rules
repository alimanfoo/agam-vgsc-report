# Manuscript
# ==========
#
# This snakefile has rules to build the main manuscript, including all artwork and tables.
#
# N.B., all rules in this file assume that all source files, including any data required,
# are present within the GitHub repository. Thus it should be possible to execute all rules
# within the CI environment.
#

# Setup
# -----
#
# Rules in this section include source and setup scripts, to ensure any changes in these will
# trigger a rebuild.
